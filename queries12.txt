🔄 Test UPDATE Trigger
UPDATE Library 
SET Price = 700.00 
WHERE Book_ID = 1;


Check audit table:

SELECT * FROM Library_Audit;


You will see entry with Action_Type = 'UPDATE' and old price 550.00.

❌ Test DELETE Trigger
DELETE FROM Library
WHERE Book_ID = 2;


Check audit table again:

SELECT * FROM Library_Audit;


You will now see entry with Action_Type = 'DELETE'.
